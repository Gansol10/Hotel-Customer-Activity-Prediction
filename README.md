# Hotel-Customer-Activity-Prediction
Overview

This project focuses on predicting hotel customer activity using advanced machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to build a robust model to predict booking statuses and reduce business losses caused by cancellations or no-shows.

Objective

- Utilizing machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

- Comparing sequential and functional approaches to determine the best-performing model.
  
- Providing actionable insights to minimize business losses.

- Creating deployment to Huggingface
